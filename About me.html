		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I am 18 years old and in college studying in Information Technology in Manila Central University. I was born on Oct 12, 2004 in Caloocan City and is the youngest
		son of <u>Hazel Joyce M. Mateo</u> who used to work in the school I am attending now when i was little. I have a sister who, like me, is also attending in MCU and 
		is taking a course in Pharmacy. Her name is <u>Jhada Ysabelle M. Gatdula</u>, she is 1 year older than me and is much more diligent in her studies than me.
		
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Growing up, I never really have that much ambition and like to go with the flow, adapting quickly to what is given to me. I never really complained whenever we
		had to move and change schools since I am an introverted person who only speaks when spoken to, but talks alot to people I know. I don't have any long term friends
		who I keep in touch of and most friendships I have end when the schoolyear ends. One of the reasons that I don't keep in touch of my old classmates is because i rarely
		use social media. If another person has alot of the same interests, you would find me talking alot to that person.
		
		<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The current me still has little to no ambition still, but has a little more confidence in myself due to helping my classmates in the lesson during
		classes.The reason why I chose IT is because I didn't have any particular direction on my life and my parents said that if I don't choose any course I would go to
		IT.I am having fun coding right now with helping my classmates when they get confused on something they don't understand. Which is a surprise for me since I don't have
		a particular interest in coding.
